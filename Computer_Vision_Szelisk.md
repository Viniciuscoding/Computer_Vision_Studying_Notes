# Notes

PAG 17
1. Come up with a detailed problem definition
2. Decide the constraints and specifications of the problem.
3. Look for techniques known to work. Try them and evaluate their performance before choosing any of them.
4. Have a realistic test data
  a. Synthetic data in order to veify correctnes and analyze noise sensitivity.
  b. Real-world data to finally fully test the system.

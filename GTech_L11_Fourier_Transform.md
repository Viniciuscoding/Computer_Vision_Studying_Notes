# Lesson 11 - Fourier Transform

**DEF** ```Natural Images have similar power spectrum, so what really maters to reconstruct the image is the phase.```

``` Convolution in spacial domain is the multiplication in frequency domain and vice-verse.
NOTE: * = convolution and x = multiplication
         Spacial Domain         Frequency Domain
           g = f * h               G = F x H
           g = f x h               G = F * H

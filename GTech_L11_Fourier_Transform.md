# Lesson 11 - Fourier Transform

**DEF:** ```Natural Images have similar power spectrum, so what really maters to reconstruct the image is the phase.```

### Ringing - Process of reducing high frequency in an image
Spurious signals near sharp transitions in a signal. This effect is caused by distortion or loss of high frequency information in image.
The term "ringing" is because the output signal oscillates at a fading rate around a sharp transition in the input
Many phenomenon like Gibbs Phenomenon( you canâ€™t approximate sharp edges in images very well) are caused due to that

**DEF:** ```Convolution in spatial domain is the multiplication in frequency domain and vice-verse.```
``` Convolution in spatial domain is the multiplication in frequency domain and vice-verse.

           g = f * h               G = F x H
           g = f x h               G = F * H

TERMS: * = convolution and x = multiplication

NOTE: If f and h is too large? It is when we use Fourier Trasform.
